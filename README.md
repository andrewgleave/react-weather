###React Weather

Example React weather application that uses [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io) API and Google Maps for Geocoding.

Build as part of an Intro to React [Code Club](http://codeclub.im/2014/07/introduction-react-scratch-kids-lots/) talk.

Includes `server.go`, a simple Go-based JSON API to handle geocoding and interfacing with Forecast's API.

###Getting started
To get up and running, you'll need to set `rootAssetPath` to the absolute path of your cloned repo, and replace the placeholder string in `forecastURL` with your own key.
