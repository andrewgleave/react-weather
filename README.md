###React Weather

Example React weather application that uses [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io) API and Google Maps for Geocoding.

Build as part of an Intro to React [Code Club](http://codeclub.im) talk.

Includes `server.go`, a simple Go-based JSON API to handle geocoding and interfacing with Forecast's API.
